This small project is a demonstration of how the attach/detach mechanic works. 

The player is able to click and drag the arm out of the robot and have it "detach" from the body. 
They can also reattach the arm by moving it back into position. A "shadow" version of the arm will 
be visible when the arm is close enough to be reattached. Also the arm highlights whenever the 
mouse hovers over it to indicate that it's interactable.

Modular design was of utmost importance and the scripts were made so that they 
could be reused on other robot parts with ease.

Enjoy!
